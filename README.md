#Basic chessbot for learning

My attempt at making a basic chessbot from "scratch," meaning no libraries outside of std/other c++ standard libraries or libraries I create. 

Entirely a personal project, with no real unique spin or goal beyond a functional chessbot that plugs in with UCI and can play against other bots. Will likely add features over time and improve as I get better.
